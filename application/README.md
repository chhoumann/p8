# Cypress
## Commands
Open cypress using ```npx cypress open```. This will pop up with a UI. Here, you can see your tests and see the code execute.

## Writing tests/specifications
In ./cypress/e2e is a simple example of a todo component. To create a test, create cypress file (xxx.cy.ts).
When creating tests, a single file should fully specify the behavior of the CUT.
