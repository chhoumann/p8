abstract = {The role of prototypes is well established in the field of HCI and Design. A lack of knowledge, however, about the fundamental nature of prototypes still exists. Researchers have attempted to identify different types of prototypes, such as low- vs. high-fidelity prototypes, but these attempts have centered on evaluation rather than support of design exploration. There have also been efforts to provide new ways of thinking about the activity of using prototypes, such as experience prototyping and paper prototyping, but these efforts do not provide a discourse for understanding fundamental characteristics of prototypes. In this article, we propose an anatomy of prototypes as a framework for prototype conceptualization. We view prototypes not only in their role in evaluation but also in their generative role in enabling designers to reflect on their design activities in exploring a design space. We base this framework on the findings of two case studies that reveal two key dimensions: prototypes as filters and prototypes as manifestations. We explain why these two dimensions are important and how this conceptual framework can benefit our field by establishing more solid and systematic knowledge about prototypes and prototyping.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the User-Centred Design approach. It presents UCD assumptions and concepts, the benefits for users of the products developed under it, and the complications that this practice can bring, since implies in constant iterations and user omnipresence. As a result, we discuss a possible increment of time and budget as well as reviews on this approach front to the market urgency of technology and innovation. It can be seen that although each situation deserves appropriate adjustments for the profile, the best design is still the user-centred. Examples of this approach application with children enhance the discussion over its flexibility and the gains of design projects oriented by user needs and desires.}

In the past few years, computer systems have come to dominate not just our technological growth, but the foundations of our world’s major industries. This text seeks to lay out the fundamental concepts of this huge and continually growing subject area in a clear and comprehensive manner. The Tenth Edition contains new information that highlights various technological updates of recent years, providing readers with highly relevant and current information. Sommerville’s experience in system dependability and systems engineering guides the text through a traditional plan-based approach that incorporates some novel agile methods. The text strives to teach the innovators of tomorrow how to create software that will make our world a better, safer, and more advanced place to live},

  abstract = {Agile development methodologies promise higher customer satisfaction, lower defect rates, faster development times and a solution to rapidly changing requirements. Plan-driven approaches promise predictability, stability, and high assurance. However, both approaches have shortcomings that, if left unaddressed, can lead to project failure. The challenge is to balance the two approaches to take advantage of their strengths and compensate for their weaknesses. We believe this can be accomplished using a risk -based approach for structuring projects to incorporate both agile and disciplined approaches in proportion to a project’s needs. This paper presents six observations drawn from our efforts to develop such an approach. We follow those observations with some practical advice to organizations seeking to integrate agile and plan-driven methods in their development process. The material presented here is drawn from our book Balancing Agility and Discipline: A Guide to the Perplexed (Addison Wesley, 2003) .},
