  abstract   = {The role of prototypes is well established in the field of HCI and Design. A lack of knowledge, however, about the fundamental nature of prototypes still exists. Researchers have attempted to identify different types of prototypes, such as low- vs. high-fidelity prototypes, but these attempts have centered on evaluation rather than support of design exploration. There have also been efforts to provide new ways of thinking about the activity of using prototypes, such as experience prototyping and paper prototyping, but these efforts do not provide a discourse for understanding fundamental characteristics of prototypes. In this article, we propose an anatomy of prototypes as a framework for prototype conceptualization. We view prototypes not only in their role in evaluation but also in their generative role in enabling designers to reflect on their design activities in exploring a design space. We base this framework on the findings of two case studies that reveal two key dimensions: prototypes as filters and prototypes as manifestations. We explain why these two dimensions are important and how this conceptual framework can benefit our field by establishing more solid and systematic knowledge about prototypes and prototyping.},

It presents UCD assumptions and concepts, the benefits for users of the products developed under it, and the complications that this practice can bring, since implies in constant iterations and user omnipresence. As a result, we discuss a possible increment of time and budget as well as reviews on this approach front to the market urgency of technology and innovation. It can be seen that although each situation deserves appropriate adjustments for the profile, the best design is still the user-centred. Examples of this approach application with children enhance the discussion over its flexibility and the gains of design projects oriented by user needs and desires.}

  abstract = {Agile development methodologies promise higher customer satisfaction, lower defect rates, faster development times and a solution to rapidly changing requirements. Plan-driven approaches promise predictability, stability, and high assurance. However, both approaches have shortcomings that, if left unaddressed, can lead to project failure. The challenge is to balance the two approaches to take advantage of their strengths and compensate for their weaknesses. We believe this can be accomplished using a risk -based approach for structuring projects to incorporate both agile and disciplined approaches in proportion to a project’s needs. This paper presents six observations drawn from our efforts to develop such an approach. We follow those observations with some practical advice to organizations seeking to integrate agile and plan-driven methods in their development process. The material presented here is drawn from our book Balancing Agility and Discipline: A Guide to the Perplexed (Addison Wesley, 2003) .},

  abstract = {Contemporary office buildings commonly experience changes in occupancy patterns and needs due to changes in business practice and personal churns. Hence, it is important to understand and accurately capture the information of such trends for applications in building design and subsequent building operations. Detection of occupant presence has been used extensively in built environments for applications such as demand-controlled ventilation and security, and occupancy profiles are widely used in building simulations. However, the ability to discern the actual number of people in a space is often beyond the scope of current sensing techniques. This paper presents a study to develop algorithms for occupancy number detection based on the analysis of environmental data captured from existing sensors and ambient sensing networks. Both wireless and wired sensor networks are deployed in the Robert L. Preger Intelligent Workplace (IW) at Carnegie Mellon University, comprising six different types of sensors. An average of 80\% accuracy on the occupancy number detection was achieved by Hidden Markov Models during testing periods. The findings also offer encouraging possibilities for incorporating the algorithms into building management systems for optimizing energy use while maintaining occupant comfort.}

Unlike systems which exploit the Wi-Fi Received Signal Strength (RSS) and Channel State Information (CSI), PWR systems can directly be applied in any environment covered by an existing WiFi local area network without special modifications to the Wi-Fi access point. Specifically, we apply Cross Ambiguity Function (CAF) processing to generate Range-Doppler maps, then we use Time-Frequency transforms to generate Doppler spectrograms, and finally employ a CLEAN algorithm to remove the direct signal interference. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and sliding-window based feature selection scheme is then used for classification. Experimental results collected from a typical office environment are used to validate the proposed PWR system for accurately determining room occupancy, and correctly predict the number of people when using four test subjects in experimental measurements.},

  abstract = {Companies face a problem where employees reserve rooms and do not show up, which leads to money and resources loss for the companies. An application capable of detecting the presence of people in a room could solve this problem. This thesis details the process of building an Android application capable of detecting the presence of people in a static room using motion detection. The application was developed through a ﬁve-staged process and evaluated by performing experiments which measured the accuracy of the application. The ﬁnished application is installed on a Sony Xperia M4 Aqua device which is mounted high up on a wall in a conference room where the application takes images of the room. The application is connected to a Google Drive account where the application uploads acquired images with an appropriate label. The application achieved an accuracy of 94.18\% in an experiment where 550 images where taken automatically by the application in diﬀerent conference rooms with and without people inside them.},

  abstract = {A novel deep-learning people detection algorithm using omnidirectional cameras is presented, which only requires point-based annotations, unlike most of the prominent works that require bounding box annotations. Thus, the effort of manually annotating the needed training databases is significantly reduced, allowing a faster system deployment. The algorithm is based on a novel deep neural network architecture that implements the concept of Grid of Spatial-Aware Classifiers, but allowing end-to-end training that improves the performance of the whole system. The designed algorithm satisfactorily handles the severe geometric distortions of the omnidirectional images, which typically degrades the performance of state-of-the-art detectors, without requiring any camera calibration. The algorithm has been evaluated in well-known omnidirectional image databases (PIROPO, BOMNI, and MW-18Mar) and compared with several works of the state of the art.}

  abstract = {During recent years, considerable progress has been achieved by researchers in Computer Vision towards a theory of visual motion detection. There also appears to be a convergence of these theories towards models of human vision derived from psychophysical analysis. Scale space issues have been tackled and elegant optimization formulations of the problem are available. On the other hand, there seems to considerable doubt about how to use the motion information for various problems in robotics. While our theoretical understanding of the geometry of image flow has greatly improved, and even a few algorithms to recover structure from motion are available, the current algorithms are not sufficiently robust or accurate for practical use. In this paper, we briefly summarize the state of the art in motion detection, and derive a set of requirement for motion analysis which are based on the needs of mobile robotics, as well as on what information seems available from visual motion. Specifically, a paradigm called directed perception is proposed, and three major problems are identified spatio-temporal grouping, the detection of specific types of dynamic events, and the incremental recovery of detailed shape and motion. A key depature from traditional approaches is that the emphasis shifts from detailed surface reconstruction to grouping, and from quantitative motion parameter computation to qualitative dynamic event detection.}

  abstract     = {It is well established that model-based controllers with an integrated control model and information about indoor climate disturbances have the ability to drastically improve the performance of building automation systems. In offices, occupancy is one of the most important disturbances to account for in this context, but the available methods for accurately determining the number of people are commonly too complex for considering at most sites. However, since model-based controllers can be made robust, input deficiencies can to a certain degree be compensated for, and in this work, a two step procedure was applied to investigate the potential of utilizing simplified estimations generated from CO2 sensor responses. First, the expected time delay and error of such estimations were derived experimentally for various occupancy changes and ventilation flow rates. Next, an office site was simulated and the occupancy information used by a model-based controller for ventilation control was stepwise subjected to various errors and time delays by considering the expected values as references. The results showed that the estimations in many case were sufficient for achieving a high control performance, but beyond a certain level, the deficiencies could only be met by an increased complexity of the controller.},
