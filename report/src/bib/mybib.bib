  abstract   = {The role of prototypes is well established in the field of HCI and Design. A lack of knowledge, however, about the fundamental nature of prototypes still exists. Researchers have attempted to identify different types of prototypes, such as low- vs. high-fidelity prototypes, but these attempts have centered on evaluation rather than support of design exploration. There have also been efforts to provide new ways of thinking about the activity of using prototypes, such as experience prototyping and paper prototyping, but these efforts do not provide a discourse for understanding fundamental characteristics of prototypes. In this article, we propose an anatomy of prototypes as a framework for prototype conceptualization. We view prototypes not only in their role in evaluation but also in their generative role in enabling designers to reflect on their design activities in exploring a design space. We base this framework on the findings of two case studies that reveal two key dimensions: prototypes as filters and prototypes as manifestations. We explain why these two dimensions are important and how this conceptual framework can benefit our field by establishing more solid and systematic knowledge about prototypes and prototyping.},

It presents UCD assumptions and concepts, the benefits for users of the products developed under it, and the complications that this practice can bring, since implies in constant iterations and user omnipresence. As a result, we discuss a possible increment of time and budget as well as reviews on this approach front to the market urgency of technology and innovation. It can be seen that although each situation deserves appropriate adjustments for the profile, the best design is still the user-centred. Examples of this approach application with children enhance the discussion over its flexibility and the gains of design projects oriented by user needs and desires.}

  abstract = {Agile development methodologies promise higher customer satisfaction, lower defect rates, faster development times and a solution to rapidly changing requirements. Plan-driven approaches promise predictability, stability, and high assurance. However, both approaches have shortcomings that, if left unaddressed, can lead to project failure. The challenge is to balance the two approaches to take advantage of their strengths and compensate for their weaknesses. We believe this can be accomplished using a risk -based approach for structuring projects to incorporate both agile and disciplined approaches in proportion to a project’s needs. This paper presents six observations drawn from our efforts to develop such an approach. We follow those observations with some practical advice to organizations seeking to integrate agile and plan-driven methods in their development process. The material presented here is drawn from our book Balancing Agility and Discipline: A Guide to the Perplexed (Addison Wesley, 2003) .},

  abstract = {Contemporary office buildings commonly experience changes in occupancy patterns and needs due to changes in business practice and personal churns. Hence, it is important to understand and accurately capture the information of such trends for applications in building design and subsequent building operations. Detection of occupant presence has been used extensively in built environments for applications such as demand-controlled ventilation and security, and occupancy profiles are widely used in building simulations. However, the ability to discern the actual number of people in a space is often beyond the scope of current sensing techniques. This paper presents a study to develop algorithms for occupancy number detection based on the analysis of environmental data captured from existing sensors and ambient sensing networks. Both wireless and wired sensor networks are deployed in the Robert L. Preger Intelligent Workplace (IW) at Carnegie Mellon University, comprising six different types of sensors. An average of 80\% accuracy on the occupancy number detection was achieved by Hidden Markov Models during testing periods. The findings also offer encouraging possibilities for incorporating the algorithms into building management systems for optimizing energy use while maintaining occupant comfort.}
