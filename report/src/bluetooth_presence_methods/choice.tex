\section{Choice of technique}
When picking a technique for determining whether a room is occupied, we consider several criteria.
The technique must not compromise the technology criteria presented in Table \ref{lst:evaluation_criteria}.
Additionally, a system used for presence detection does no have to estimate the exact position of objects.
It only needs to be accurate enough for the system to classify the object as present or not present.
Therefore, the chosen technique should be able to support classification of object positions.  
For this purpose, lateration techniques could utilize a distance measure, and classify everything with an estimated distance smaller than some threshold as being present.
Variations of Equation \ref{distance_equation} could be examined to determine which approach is best for the system.
However, lateration approaches relies on a non-noisy environment, as they rely directly on the measured RSSI values.

Fingerprinting techniques could use the grid measurements, established in the first phase of the approach, described in Section \ref{sec:fingerprinting}, with additional labels for each cell, determining whether the cell is present or not present.
This would create a set of labelled data, where the labels of the k-nearest neighbours could be used to determine whether an object is present. 

Between the two approaches, the fingerprinting approach can easily be configured with beacons to increase accuracy.
Edge cases for this approach can be analyzed and handled by setting some threshold for when a \textit{present} label is considered correct. 
This threshold could be found experimentally or determined from existing research. 
For instance, \citeauthor{ble_kneares_neural}\cite{ble_kneares_neural} showed that a kNN approach had high number of measurements determined within a 3 meters precision. 
This precision could be used as a threshold to determine to modify which neighbours to consider.
