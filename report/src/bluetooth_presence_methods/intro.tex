Having established that BLE is a suitable technology for presence detection, we now describe current methods and techniques implementing presence detection using this technology.
To select a technique suitable for the case of Mariendal-IT, the techniques are evaluated based on ease of configuration and cost of deployment and support, as well as the accuracy and precision in terms of detection capabilities.
The cost of deployment and support involves setting up and maintaining the system. 
The cost can be calculated in aquiring and maintaining equipment involved in the system as well as the man-hours spent installing and maintaining it.
