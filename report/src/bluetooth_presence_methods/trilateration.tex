\section{Lateration}
Lateration is a technique using multiple, immovable reference points to estimate the distance to an object\cite{presence_ble_review}.
We will refer to this object as the \textit{receiver}   
When using Bluetooth, the reference points are often BLE beacons and the receiver some other Bluetooth-capable device. 
The beacons periodically broadcast a signal advertising their existence. 
The advertisement and its content are collected by the receiver, which uses it to calculate distance estimations to each beacon. 
By analysing the distance estimations, the position of the receiver is determined.
Various versions of the techniques exists.
\citeauthor{presence_ble_review}~\cite{presence_ble_review} examines five techniques each using different combinations of advertisement content to establish a distance measure and present current methods for handling the loss of signal during the analysis.

Trilateration is a form of lateration using the transmission of one or more beacons to calculate a \textit{path loss}.
Path loss defines the amount of power lost as the signal is sent across a distance of $d$ meters.
As the transmission power of the beacons is known, the loss per distance $L(d)$ can be subtracted from the transmission power to find the distance~\cite{taking_localization_to_the_wild}:
\begin{equation}
    f(d) = p_0 - L(D)
\end{equation}
The path loss is affected by background signal noise and the air in the atmosphere, and can thus be defined as $L(d) = 10n log_{10}+C$, where $C$ represents signal loss and background noise, and $n$ a loss factor. \cite{presence_ble_review}
Various models using different variants of constants $C$ and $n$ exists\cite{path_loss_models}.
Due to the many possible environmental circumstances in which the beacons and receiver may reside, the accuracy of the approach may be flawed.\cite{presence_ble_review}. 
Multiple mathematical models of the path loss formula exist \cite{rssi_indoor_pos,positioning_alg_rssi,RSSI_ZigBee_distance}, making it easy to implement locatoin approximations.
