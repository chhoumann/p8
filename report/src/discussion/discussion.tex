\chapter{Discussion}\label{chap:discussion}
In chapter x, we presented our results and our evaluation of these results. 
We found that utilizing four beacons to outline a room and a map generated by traversing the room in a grid pattern of $1m \times 1m$ we were able to achieve significant results. 
Depending on the chosen \textit{k} nearest neighbors we were able to achieve between $92.86$ and $95.71$ percent accuracy for the inside case and between $48$ and $88$ percent accuracy for the outside scenario. 
As mentioned in \ref{sec:ChoiceOfTechnique} the goal of the project was not to demonstrate high accuracy and precision on the exact positioning of persons in a room. 
The goal was rather to demonstrate that we would be able to detect the presence of people in a meeting with reasonable certainty.
Despite this objective, the results of our experimentation show that for

this project, a high level of accuracy and precision is not necessary, as occupancy
detection does not rely on exact positioning. As occupants leave the room, the
system does not need to immediately assert whether the room is occupied or not.
The assertion can be made once the system is reasonably certain that all occupants
have left the near vicinity of the meeting room.

%Summary of Key Findings: Start with a brief summary of your main findings. This helps readers understand the context for the rest of the discussion.

%Interpretation of Results: Explain what the results mean in a broader context. How do they relate to the overall purpose of your study? What are their implications?

%Relating to Previous Research: Your findings should be compared with other similar studies. Do your results agree or disagree with the existing literature? If there are discrepancies, you should try to explain why this might be. If your results are unexpected or unusual, explain why this might have happened.

%Limitations: No study is perfect, and it's important to acknowledge the limitations of your research. This might include methodological limitations, such as sample size or measurement techniques, or more general limitations, such as the scope of your research or any assumptions you've made.

%Implications: Consider the practical, theoretical, and policy implications of your findings. How can they be applied in real-world contexts? How do they contribute to the theoretical understanding of your topic?

%Future Research: What questions have been left unanswered? Where could other researchers go from here? Identify areas where further research could be beneficial to build upon your study.

%Conclusion: Wrap up your discussion with a brief conclusion that summarizes the main points you've made.

%Remember, the discussion section isn't just about presenting your findings. It's about making an argument that supports your research question and explaining how your results contribute to the existing body of knowledge. Be sure to keep it clear, concise, and focused on your research.
