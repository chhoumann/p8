\chapter{Future Work}
As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:fingerprinting}, the number of beacons and their placement affects the quality of the localization results when using fingerprinting. 
Similarly, the physical layout and the obstacles within a room can affect the classification performed in the second phase of fingerprinting. 
It is therefore relevant to experiment with several configurations related to beacon placement, number of beacons, physical room layout, and different radio wave noise within the room and in the surrounding environment. 

Future research efforts in room occupancy detection using fingerprinting via BLE should focus on finding a setup that demonstrates improved adaptability in a variety of environments.
One approach to achieving this involves further studies of strategies that can improve either the map, or the classification algorithm.
Our experiments showed that the quality of classifications degraded for positions outside the room by up to $49.91$ percent compared to indoor positions, as outlined in Table \ref{lst:resultsPhone_precision}.
Therefore, future research should experiment with different beacon configurations where, for example, one or more beacons are placed outside the meeting room. 
Future experiments might show an improvement in the map quality, resulting in better classification. Alternatively, it could show that fewer beacons are needed to achieve similar results.
Building on this, exploring alternate algorithms could be beneficial for advancing the adaptability of our system.
Potential candidates might include statistical kNN methods or machine learning approaches like support vector machines, similar to what \citeauthor{ble_kneares_neural} proposed in their paper \cite{ble_kneares_neural}. 
By gaining more insight into the impacts of algorithm and configuration variations in the experimental setup one might be able to achieve results that can be used to create a more generalized solution.

For Mariendal IT, results found in experimentation, both for the beacon configuration as well as the optimal algorithm, could be integrated into a system inspired by the prototype described in Section \ref{subsec:develop_proto}. 
In the prototype evaluation, we showed that a system solution for Mariendal IT's meeting room management should gather information about who participates in meetings (see appendix \ref{appendix:user_stories} and \ref{appendix:usability_tasks}).
A phone application, similar to the one developed in this project, could be implemented for these participants' phones. 
The application could collect adverticements from the beacons, and send RSSI values, beacon- and user identity to a server.
The server, which would have information about the phone users' calendar, could then examine the beacon values and classify whether the user is in a particular meeting room.
The classification is then compared with information from the user's calendar to establish whether the user is attending a meeting or not. 
By doing this for all meeting participants, the server can determine whether the room booked for the meeting is being used.  
This would allow the meeting participants to end the meeting early by simply leaving the room.
