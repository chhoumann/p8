This project is made in collaboration with Mariendal IT, who has acted as the stakeholder in this project.
They specialize in IT and offer services such as hosting, security, and operations management\cite{Mariendal_OmOs}.
Henceforth, Mariendal IT and its constituents will be referred to as the stakeholder. 
As a stakeholder, they provided insight towards their perceived requirements, performed prototype- and UI evaluation, and feedback regarding the developed product, by attending meetings and interviews with us.
The intended outcome of this collaboration is a system developed by us, that they would be able to use or continue development after the project is ended.

%Our stakeholders problem, was that their current system, did not have sufficient support for on-site arrangement of meetings.
%Currently, stakeholders have to interact with multiple system interfaces, to accomodate all of their needs when arranging meetings on-site. 
%These interactions are cumbersome, which is not ideal for a work environment.
