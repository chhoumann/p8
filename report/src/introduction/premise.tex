This project has been made in collaboration with Mariendal IT.
They specialize in IT and offer services such as hosting, security, and operations management\cite{Mariendal_OmOs}.
They acted as the stakeholders of this project.
Henceforth, Mariendal IT will be referred to as the stakeholder. 
As stakeholders, they provided insight towards their perceived requirements, users to perform evaluation, and feedback regarding the developed product, by attending regular meetings with us, the developers.
The intended outcome of this collaboration would be a system developed by us, that they would be able to use or continue development on after our project had ended.

Our stakeholders problem, was that their current system, did not have sufficient support for on-site arrangement of meetings.
Currently, stakeholders have to interact with multiple system interfaces, to accomodate all of their needs when arranging meetings on-site. 
These interactions are cumbersome, which is not ideal for a work environment.
