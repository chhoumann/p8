\chapter{\label{sec:presence_intro}Room Occupancy Detection Technologies}
To address the problem defined in Section \ref{sec:problem_statement}, we propose an occupancy detection system (presence system) to identify when a meeting starts, defined as participants entering a room, and when it ends, defined as all participants leaving the meeting room.
This Chapter examines various technologies that can be used in occupancy detection, evaluates them, and identifies which one of them could be used in the suggested sysem.
The chosen technology will serve as the basis for the rest of the system, which will be described in the following sections of the report.

Several technologies can be utilized for detecting room occupancy, for instance, infrared (IR) sensors\cite{woodward-2021, dodierBuildingOccupancyDetection2006, OccupancySensorMotion}, ultrasonic sensors\cite{woodward-2021, dodierBuildingOccupancyDetection2006, OccupancySensorMotion}, microwave sensors\cite{woodward-2021}, computer vision\cite{co2sensor, longoAccurateOccupancyEstimation2019, OccupancySensorMotion}, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi\cite{teissedre-2019}, pressure sensors\cite{OccupancySensorMotion}, acoustic sensors\cite{OccupancySensorMotion}, and CO2 sensors\cite{co2sensor, longoAccurateOccupancyEstimation2019, jinSensingProxyOccupancy2015}.\cite{faragherLocationFingerprintingBluetooth2015}\todo{Insert all the types you find and cite here. Remove TODO when this section is done.}
Each technology has its strengths and weaknesses in terms of accuracy, cost, and performance.

The following sections will examine technologies in three main categories: \textit{Environmental}, \textit{video-based}, and \textit{radio-based}.

\citeauthor{presence_ble_review} \cite{presence_ble_review} dictates a number of performance metrics for presence based systems. Of these, we adapt accuracy, precision and cost, but also include considerations for responsiveness, privacy, and environmental factors when evaluating the technologies.
because they cover what we believe are the key aspects necessary for the successful implementation of a system such as this.
Accuracy and responsiveness ensure reliable detection and efficient space management, while privacy addresses user confidence and regulatory compliance.
Cost ensures affordability and sustainability, and environmental factors guarantee consistent performance under varying conditions.
Taken together, these criteria help to select a technology that fits the context of use.
A short definition of each critera is given in Table~\ref{lst:presence_eval_criteria} \todo{This refers to Listing 3, but we have no idea what that is. When clicking the 3 it leads to this section - I suspect that 3 represents just the chapter}.

To determine a suitable technology, we will now evaluate the technologies based on the criteria in Listing~\ref{lst:presence_eval_criteria}.
