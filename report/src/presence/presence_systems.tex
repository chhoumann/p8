Radio-based occupancy detection systems make use of wireless communication technologies, such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, to determine the presence of individuals in a given area.
These systems exploit the fact that most people carry devices that emit wireless signals like smartphones and wearables.

By monitoring the strength and distribution of these signals, radio-based systems can infer the number of occupants and their locations within the monitored area.\cite{longoAccurateOccupancyEstimation2019}
