\section{Environmental systems}\label{sec:presence_env}
Environmental systems for occupancy detection leverage a variety of sensors that measure physical attributes of an environment, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, temperature, humidity, and infrared radiation.
These systems infer occupancy by detecting changes in environmental parameters caused by human presence.
For instance, an increase in CO2 levels may indicate occupancy due to human respiration.\cite{longoAccurateOccupancyEstimation2019}

\section{Radio-based systems}\label{sec:presence_radio}
Radio-based occupancy detection systems make use of wireless communication technologies, such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, to determine the presence of individuals in a given area.
These systems exploit the fact that most people carry devices that emit wireless signals like smartphones and wearables.
By monitoring the strength and distribution of these signals, radio-based systems can infer the number of occupants and their locations within the monitored area.\cite{longoAccurateOccupancyEstimation2019, teissedre-2019}
