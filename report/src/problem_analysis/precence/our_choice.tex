% We decided to use Bluetooth instead of object detection and environment sensing because:
% - Stakeholder prefers radio technology
% - Inconsitent accuracy (see longoAccurateOccupancyEstimation2019)
% - Affected by unpredictable opening and closing of doors and windows (see longoAccurateOccupancyEstimation2019)
% - Difficult to acquire
% - Privacy concerns (cameras, object detection, etc.)
% - Costly to setup and sensitive to light levels (video-based) 
% - Sensitive to obstrutions in room

% We decided to use Bluetooth instead of WiFi because:
% - Specifically requested by stakeholder (often used in offices)
% - Low power consumption
% - Low cost
% - Very cheap (see longoAccurateOccupancyEstimation2019)
% - Works indoor and outdoor
% - Easy to setup
% - High availability
% - In contrast to MAC address spoofing, Bluetooth devices can be identified by their Bluetooth address, which is unique to each device.
% - Ideally, we should combine Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, however we do not need such high accuracy (see longoAccurateOccupancyEstimation2019), and it would be far more expensive in terms of hardware.
% - We need local detection, however WiFi offers far greater range at the cost of accuracy, which is not needed for our application.

% Some issues with radio that we should keep in mind during development:
% - Privacy concerns
% - Not always available (based on the number of available handheld devices vs people - we cannot assume that there is a 1:1 correlation between people and number of devices).
