Having gained an understanding of the stakeholders' problems and the domain in which they recide, we could refine the initial ideas provided to us at first contact with the stakeholder.
We refined the ideas into user stories in collaboration with the stakeholder.%HOW????
These user stories were prioritized further using MoSCoW analysis\cite{DEBbook}.
A MoSCoW prioritization is a rough prioritization into four categories based on an agreement between stakeholders and the developers.
Each category describes a prioritization level of particular user stories. The four categories are as follows: \textit{Must have}, \textit{Should have}, \textit{Could have}, \textit{Wont have}.

\end{enumerate}

After performing the MoSCoW analysis and documenting the results, the derived user stories and their priority was sent to the stakeholder for feedback and to confirm mutual understanding.
Based on these user stories and their prioritization a product goal is defined in collaboration with the stakeholders.
