This report explores presence detection using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and fingerprinting. 
An analysis phase explores the needs of a company using prototype evaluation was conducted, discovering the need of a presence detection system. 
Several technologies used within localization were assessed, and it was found that BLE using fingerprinting was a suitable candidate method for presence detection. 
Then an approach to the reformulation of this localization problem to a classification problem is described.
Lastly, an app used to evaluate the chosen method of occupancy classification was developed in C\#. 
Using this app, we show that BLE with fingerprinting are suitable technique for presence detection.
