The preceding sections have laid the groundwork for understanding the choice of technology and methodology employed in our presence detection system.

Moving forward, this section is dedicated to providing a comprehensive overview of our application and its role in supporting the two phases of our chosen fingerprinting approach: data collection and classification. 

Section \ref{sec:first_phase} is devoted to elaborating on our data collection strategy during the first phase, including our method for labeling the collected data. 
Detailed discussions regarding the key design decisions and implementation considerations, which have a substantial impact on the application, are to be found in Section \ref{sec:data_collection_implementation}.

Subsequently, in Section \ref{sec:knn_implementation}, we delve into the mechanics of how the second phase of fingerprinting is realized in the application. We will outline the procedure for performing classification of the terms \textit{inside} or \textit{outside}, based on our collected and labeled data. 

By addressing these elements, this section aims to present a clear and detailed exposition of our system design, ensuring our methodology is transparent and replicable.
