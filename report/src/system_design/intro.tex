In Chapter \label{sec:presence_intro} technologies that can be utilized for presence detection were described. 
Technology selection criteria based on \citeauthor{presence_ble_review}~\cite{presence_ble_review} were developed and identified Bluetooth as the most suitable technology for a presence system satisfying the user problems described in Section \ref{sec:understanding_the_problem}.

Chapter \ref{sec:presence_detection_using_ble} then details two approaches to using Bluetooth for presence detection. We found that a fingerprinting approach using kNN is suitable for occupancy detection. 
We argue that the approach can easily be modified with additional labels when collecting data in the first phase of the approach, as described in Secton \ref{sec:fingerprinting}.

The following sections details how a presence system for room occupancy detection using fingerprinting can be designed and implemented. 
Section \ref{sec:first_phase} details how we design an application for collecting measurments for the first phase. 
We describe how we approach the data collection, and how  we accomodate the need for labelling of the collected data.
Section \ref{sec:ble_implementation} describe important implementation details this application. 
Section \ref{sec:knn_implementation} details how the second phase of fingerprinting is implemented, and how a classification of \textit{present} or \textit{absent} is performed.
