% Intro text - from data collection, but rewrite because it uses wrong terms, bad grammar, etc.
% Explain the overall design for the data collection phase by using diagrams of central components (DataCollector, etc.)
% Deep-dive into various aspects of the implementation, relying on the diagrams to explain the overall design

% Beacons broadcast a specific advertisement package
% This package contains a string of bytes
% These bytes contain information about the broadcast
% Describe the byte stream and what each part means
% Describe how we load these bytes (wrapper class)
% Remember endianness!
