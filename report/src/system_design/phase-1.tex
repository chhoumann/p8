\section{Data Collection Implementation}\label{sec:data_collection_implementation}
This section presents an an overview of the system architecture and data flow.

Figure~\ref{fig:implementation_diagram} shows the overall system architecture and data flow.
We implictly assume usage of the previously described \texttt{KBeaconData} class throughout the program flow, however we have omitted it from the diagram in the interest of keeping the overview concise and comprehensible.
