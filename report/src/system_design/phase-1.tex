% Intro text - from data collection, but rewrite.
% Explain the overall design for the data collection phase by using diagrams of central components (DataCollector, etc.)
% Deep-dive into various aspects of the implementation, relying on the diagrams to explain the overall design

\input{system_design/data_collection_design.tex}

% use this as reference for the following sections, as we base our implementation on this
% data class - contains structured parses of the data we receive from the beacons
\input{system_design/kbeacondata.tex}

% overall section to describe the implementation of the data collection system
% uses system diagram & frontend  as reference, along with selected code snippets
% to explain the system implementation
