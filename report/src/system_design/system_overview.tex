\section{System overview}
The system is designed to have a primary page respesonsible for interactive elements for device selection, room detection, and data collection management. This page interacts with various services including the \texttt{BLEScannerService}, \texttt{RssiDataCollector}, \texttt{RssiDataHandler}, and \texttt{BLEAdvertisementScanner}, to carry out device scanning, data collection, and processing.
These services are connected in an event driven manner, which can be partitioned into several stages, where services are activated based on the input from the user interface. 
Figure \ref{fig:StateDiagram} is a state diagram illustrating the different stages.
