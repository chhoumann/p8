This chapter describes our approach for system evaluation. 
Section \ref{sec:experiment_design} describes how phase one is performed.
It details physical environment in which experiments are carried out, which items are used, and how data collection was accomplished.
Section \ref{sec:experiment_results} evaluates the results of the system. 
This is done by carrying out the second phase of the implemented approach using kNN. 
Measurements from the second phase is collected, and the accuracy of the system is determined in terms of correct classifications.
