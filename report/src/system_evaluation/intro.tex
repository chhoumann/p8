This chapter describes our approach to an experimental system evaluation.
Section \ref{sec:experiment_design} details how the application described in xxx is used to create a fingerprinting map, while Section \ref{xxx}\todo{ ref these sections when they exists} details how this map is used to evaluate the application.
We detail the physical environment in which the experiments are carried out, which items are used when performing the experiment, and how data collection is conducted.
Section \ref{sec:experiment_results} evaluates the results of the system in terms of adequate acucracy, as described in Section \ref{sec:presence_intro}.
