This chapter describes our approach to an experimental system evaluation.
Section \ref{sec:experiment_design} gives an overview of the experimental setup, and details the physical area in which the experiment takes place, while Section \ref{sec:eval_phase1} and \ref{sec:eval_phase2} details how the system described in Chapter \ref{chap:system_design} is used to create a fingerprinting map, and how this map is used to evaluate the application.
Section \ref{sec:experiment_results} details the results of the system evaluatino in terms of correct classification.
