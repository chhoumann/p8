Experiments for the evaluation of the implemented system are carried out in an n times n meeting room.
In the room, a partition and a cabinet are placed between two tables, effectively dividing a single meeting room into two smaller areas. 
In each of the smaller areas a table with six chairs is placed and on the walls are placed whiteboards.

On one end of each table is a large, rectangular window.
Furthermore, one table has a large TV screen placed near the window. 
Near the door of the room, an airconditioning controller and a large glass window are located.
Lighting is built into the ceiling, thus no hanging light will interfere with the broadcasted signals. 
Outside the meeting room is a common area.
This area contains two high tables.
Each of these tables has a small couch and two chairs placed next to it.   
The meeting room and its surrounding area is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:experiment_room}.

In the room is placed x yyyyy beacons supporting the \cite{apple}
