\section{Requirement Elicitation}\label{sec:requirement_elicitation}
To gather requirements for this project we would first have to arrange a meeting with the stakeholder. 
Before the initial meeting we had we had received a list of ideas that could alleviate the stakeholders problem.
We were told that the system would be used for booking meeting rooms, and associated tasks. 
This gave us a broad idea of the problem, but we did not know specifics, such as what devices it would have to run on, or communicate with.
Due to not knowing the specifics about the problem, we could not create close-ended questions for a structured interview, as it would require further knowledge about the domain.
Therefore we chose to perform a semi-structured interview as a part of our first meeting.
A semi-structured focuses on open-ended questions which allows us to ask complementary questions to clarify answers. 
The interview questions were based on initial ideas sent to us by the stakeholder. 
This allowed us to explore the whole problem, while minimizing the risk of missing points that the stakeholders would deem important. \cite{InterviewsNHS}


%We need a section that describes the user and the situation in much more detail.

After conducting the interview, we refined the ideas into user stories in collaboration with the stakeholder. These user stories were prioritized further using MoSCoW analysis\cite{DEBbook}.
These were sent to the stakeholder for feedback and to confirm mutual understanding.

A MoSCoW prioritization is a rough prioritization into four categories based on an agreement between stakeholders and the developers.
Each category describes a prioritization level of particular user stories. The four categories are as follows: \textit{Must have}, \textit{Should have}, \textit{Could have}, \textit{Wont have}.
