\subsection{Must have}
\begin{itemize}
\item As a user, I want to be able to book a meeting room through Outlook/Outlook mobile and select it as a location, so that I can easily schedule my meetings and reserve a space.
\item As a user, I want to be able to book a meeting room through a website and view it in Outlook afterward, so that I can use the platform that is most convenient for me.
\item As a user, I want to be able to see who has booked a meeting room, so that I can avoid scheduling conflicts and ensure that the room is available when I need it.
\item As a user, I want there to be a screen at each meeting room displaying the name of the person who has booked it (without meeting details), and the ability to book the room immediately for an upcoming meeting.
\item As a user, I want the platform to use MFA login for both users and the admin page, to ensure that only authorized individuals can access and use the system.
\item As an administrator, I want to be able to create multiple customers, each with their own unique administration flow, so that I can set up and manage multiple organizations within a single solution. % In the context of the Microsoft ecosystem, this would correspond to multiple tenants.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Should have}

\subsection{Could have}
\begin{itemize}
\item As a user, I want to be able to display an info screen if there are no meetings scheduled, until a certain time before the next meeting. This would allow me to use the meeting room for other purposes, such as advertisements or presentations, when it is not being used for meetings.
\end{itemize}
